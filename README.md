Business understanding:

• The objective of this project is to diagnostically determine a person's likelihood of having diabetes. A person is diabetic or not depends on these features 
the outcome is not dependent on combined relation between features. It completely dependent on independent values. So all the features are independently contributing the outcome.

• And Doctors are going to consider these features independently to tell a patient is diabetic or not and prescribe medicines.

• Hence we will go with :
